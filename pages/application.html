        <p class="home-developer-text">We are looking for someone experienced with a strong portfolio to join our team.
            We have a very iterative workflow and strive for detail and high quality for every interaction in our games.
            You will also be involved in testing throughout the production
            and integrating the results back into these iterations. We are particularly looking for a candidate who
            enjoys setting their own goals and taking responsibility for their own schedule. We are a close-knit group
            of developers, and working within
            that group requires an ability to adapt to the existing visual style and methods while contributing your own
            ideas to the whole. More than anything, we are looking for someone who is excited about all facets of game
            development, as well as
            being passionate about gaming overall.</p>

            focus on creating new
            experiences, and as such we are looking for people who can help us achieve them.<br><Br>
            Our approach to development does not include crunching towards arbitrary deadlines - instead, we

            friendly, collaborative environment.<br><br>
            We love to make carefully crafted games with obsessive attention to detail and are always on the lookout for
