                <h3 class="home-middle-title">History</h3>
                <p class="home-developer-text"> Founded in 2018 by game designer Steven Duggan, I.R.L. Games is
                    committed to developing broadly accessible, artistic, thought-provoking and fun experiences. Our
                    work includes titles such as En-Trance, ShinoBoy, i-SO and Wave Runner that
                    have appeared on PC and current gen consoles. Today, we are a team of four creative professionals,
                    coming from a broad range of experience and education. Our hope is to expand the range of
                    experiences possible in video games so that
                    they can be enjoyed and loved by people of all ages, cultures and backgrounds. We are hard at work
                    on bringing our games to more players - and on making new ones.

                <h3 class="home-middle-title">Studio</h3>
                <p class="home-developer-text"> Our studio uses a unique approach through experimentation, iteration and
                    collaboration to create an entertaining experience. We take pride in making games that are
                    intutitive and enjoyed by everyone. We are designers, artists, musicians,
                    writers and creators trying to make an impact and positive change with our games. Our team is made
                    up of a mix of diverse talent and experience.
